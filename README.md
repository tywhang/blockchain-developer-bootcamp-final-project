# TicketMaster Replacement

### Motivation 
TicketMaster and related ticketing services have flaws in these categories:

##### Problems with company with a near-monopoly
1. Unproportionally high fees
2. Non-transparent fees (ex: Convenience Fee)
3. Slow to refund when events get cancelled (ex: COVID-19 cancellations)
4. Centralized servers can go down, causing operational issues.

##### Problems on secondary market
1. Fraudulent tickets on secondary market
2. High mark-ups on secondary market
3. Fraudulent ticket sales (ex: sending money and not getting a ticket)

 
### Product

##### MVP
###### Buy, sell, and redeem tickets
1. Event organizers can issue a finite # of tickets
2. Attendees can buy tickets
3. Attendees can redeem tickets at the event (cannot be double spent)
4. Fees for services will be transparent
5. No concerns about technical back-end issues as attendees will be interacting directly with the blockchain.

##### Level 2
###### Reseller market
1. Attendees can sell tickets on marketplace and list own prices
2. Event organizers can remove price mark ups on secondary market
3. Attendees can swap tickets with other users (user can pay out the difference in price)

##### Level 3
###### Event cancellations
1. Oracles can be used to verify that an event has indeed occurred.
2. Contract can hold funds in escrow until a confirmation of event occurrence. Then pay out or refund ticket buyers.
